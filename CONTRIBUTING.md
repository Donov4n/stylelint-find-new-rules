Contributing
=============

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this *free* course:  
[EggHead.io - How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)

Feel free to open an issue to discuss feature requests, or if you're savvy, just PR.

Style Guide
------------

This project happily uses [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier), a tool that
automatically reformat's code with almost zero configuration.  
The result is a consistent code style and happy unicorns.

There's a Git `precommit` hook in this repo (using [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky)), so when you commit, all files will get formatted with prettier and committed.

You can also setup [editor-integration](https://github.com/prettier/prettier#editor-integration).
